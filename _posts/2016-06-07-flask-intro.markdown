Yesterday 6th June, I participated in a tutorial session on [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), via google hangout (What happened to the chat option?). Ramaseshan arranged the session; he invited [Abhinav]() who uses flask for his web applications, as the speaker. What is Flask?

It is a lightweight web framework for people who think [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a way too complicated tool for the job. Most of my code in Deep learning is exclusively written in python (numpy, theano, keras, scipy). And I don't want to get too deep into the "web" side of things. Hence, Flask is an ideal tool for me.
