## Linear Algebra Revision

To study advanced machine learning, it is recommended to know a few concepts in Linear Algebra like Matrix calculus, Eigen Decomposition, etc. But for this course, we just need to remember a few matrix operations like matrix addition, multiplication, inversion from high school. Let's start with how we represent a matrix. A matrix is typically of 2 dimensions, represented by [m,n]. A matrix with just one row or one column is called a vector. 

$$
A + B = C
\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3\\4 & 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 & 9\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}2 & 2 & 3\\4 & 6 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 & 10\end{bmatrix}
$$
