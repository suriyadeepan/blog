Hi! This is Suriyadeepan from Puducherry, India. I've done this many times before. Start a new blog, introduce myself, write about what is going on currently and then forget about the blog altogether. I just need a place to log my activities. The problem is that there are too many solutions and being who I am, I tend to try a lot of different things and not stick to one platform. Well, this is me putting my roots down. Choosing one platform and sticking to it.

> **Beautiful Jekyll** template seems, well, beautiful. And simple. 

What will I do differently this time? To keep the blog alive, I need to log an entry at least once a week. It's not like my life is boring. Lots of interesting events happen every week. This time the focus is on the frequency of logging instead of quality of content.
