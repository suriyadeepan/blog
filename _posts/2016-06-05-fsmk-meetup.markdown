After the BangPypers meetup on Saturday, we went to the FSMK office on Sunday 22nd May, to have discussion on Mesh Networks. We were hoping that this meet would spark some interesting ideas and lead to a Meshnet initiative in Bangalore. We being myself, Ganesh, Selvakumar, Ramaseshan and Raj Anand. We met Arun Issac, Kaushik and Vignesh at the office. To be honest, I was a tad disappointed as I expected more people to show up, nonetheless we had a healthy discussion. 

I explained what is currently going on in [pymesh](http://pymeshnet.gitlab.io), the challenges we are facing, the problems we have solved and how we intend to move forward. We discussed the possibility of starting a similar initiative in Bangalore. Kaushik mentioned that he is experimenting with the Freifunk's custom firmware for routers, based on openwrt. I adviced him to try a openwrt image directly, as Freifunk, by default restricts users to configure the router after flashing it, while plain openwrt provides the user ssh access and the flexibility to configure pretty much everything in the router. We talked about the kind of antennas we experimented with. Ganesh explained the specifics of how we built our Yagi-Uda antenna. 

Most part of the discussion focused on social outreach. We explained our plan to reach people through social media, by advertising through posters in the regions covered by our mesh nodes and by conducting events at colleges. Later, we demonstrated how to install and use B.A.T.M.A.N and tried Serval Mesh, a P2P VoIP application.    

After lunch we met Raghuram and introduced ourselves to him. We talked about KariGLUG's Libre Digital Library which serves an offline copy of wikipedia and other resources like ebooks under CC and how we could start a network by first putting up a few nodes which serve some valuable resources and then build on it gradually. We parted ways after a short while, hoping to meet again soon.
