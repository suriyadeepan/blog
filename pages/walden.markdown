*Where I Lived, and What I Lived for*

> We must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by mechanical aids, but by an infinite expectation of the dawn, which does not forsake us in our soundest sleep.
> I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor. 
> It is something to be able to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful; 
> but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look, which morally we can do.
> To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts. 
> Every man is tasked to make his life, even in its details, worth of the contemplation of his most elevated and critical hour.
