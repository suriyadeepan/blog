## [Social Community Network](/pages/proposals/socialcommnet)

On a global scale, there exists a huge divide between people who have access to internet and those do not. In India, roughly 15% of the population has access to internet. As a result, 85% of the population is excluded from the digital world. They do not have a platform for free speech and debate.  We address the digital divide in India and propose a long-term solution that gradually bridges this divide. Our system, once implemented, will encourage people to take up an active role in the development of their community. We propose to do this by making it easier for people to discuss and share their opinion on issues and through incentives.  It will increase awareness among people, about regional conflicts by facilitating direct interaction with people from other communities, instead of involving third party commercial services, like newspapers, media, etc,. In a developing country, there are a large number of unresolved issues, like lack of infrastructure, poor sanitation, frequent power cuts, etc,. By reporting these issues and logging them in a transparent platform, it makes it easier for common people and the expert teams, to localize the problem and understand it and possibly lead to a solution. The system that we propose, is fundamentally a community network, jointly owned and maintained by the community, without a central authority. We believe, the proposed system if implemented carefully in an incremental fashion, can bring about significant social and economic changes in the society, by bridging people together.
