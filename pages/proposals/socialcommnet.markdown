I recently studied a few papers on Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data. Most of the researcher in the field of NLP, feel that Twitter is a gold mine for opinion mining. Because it reflects the mind set of the general population. Twitter serves as a safe bubble for people to exercise their right to free speech. By looking at the twitter feed for hash tags, say for example **#iphone7**, we can get an idea whether Apple is offering what they advertised. People are honest and carefree on twitter. And that is the essence of free speech.

## The Great Internet Asymmetry

The claim that twitter reflects the opinion of the people, is not entirely accurate. There is a huge divide between people who have access to internet and those who do not. It is safe to assume that twitter reflects the opinion of the urban crowd. The voices of rural people go unheard. The objective of this project is to empower the rural people to participate in free speech.

## Anonymity

There are incidents in India, where people are arrested for criticizing politicians on Facebook. This calls for anonymity. Every whistle-blower will be ensured anonymity.
