I recently studied a few papers on Sentiment Analysis on Twitter data. Most of the researcher in the field of NLP, feel that Twitter is a gold mine for opinion mining. Because it reflects the mind set of the general population. Twitter serves as a safe bubble for people to exercise their right to free speech. By looking at the twitter feed for hash tags, say for example **#iphone7**, we can get an idea whether Apple is offering what they advertised. People are honest and carefree on twitter. And that is the essence of free speech.

## The Great Internet Asymmetry

The claim that twitter reflects the opinion of the people, is not entirely accurate. There is a huge divide between people who have access to internet and those who do not. It is safe to assume that twitter reflects the opinion of the urban crowd. The voices of rural people go unheard. The objective of this project is to empower the rural people to participate in free speech.

## Anonymity

There are incidents in India, where people are arrested for criticizing politicians on Facebook. This calls for anonymity. Every whistle-blower will be ensured anonymity.

## Solutions

How does the government solve a problem? A think tank is formed : A team of experts who study the problem and provide an optimal solution. The knowledge of the common people is more valuable than any expert. The local people not only understand the problem, they also understand the circumstances and consequences. We propose a common platform, where people are encouraged to discuss existing social problem and propose their solutions collaboratively. This solution will provide useful insights to the team of experts and help them implement a solution efficiently, with the consent of the local people.

## Use cases

1. Report a flaw (Poorly laid roads, open drains, Improper Chemical waste disposal, etc,.)
2. Report an incident (Unauthorized cut down of trees, Noise pollution)
3. 

## Medium

1. Internet
2. SMS
3. Community Networks

## Network Model

1. Leaf Nodes <- Mobile phones/Commons Infrastructure
2. Processing Nodes (Beaglebone)
3. Gateway Nodes -> Internet

## Data model

1. Timestamp
2. Location : GPS coordinates [ municipality, counselor ]
3. Flaw/Incident

## Common Platform

> People who understand the social problems and are willing to talk about it, do not have a proper platform available for sharing. The primary goal of this project, is to empower the community minded <*rephrase*> individuals and make sure that their voice is heard.

The network that we are proposing should grow oganically. Our objective is to kickstart this network of networks, by bootstraping the initial leaf nodes and to facilitate this growth.
