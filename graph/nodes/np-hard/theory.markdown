title: P, NP, NP-hard and NP-complete
---

1. **P** - A problem that can be solved in polynomial time (linear, quadratic, cubic, etc,.)
2. **NP** *Non-deterministic polynomial* - Once you have a solution, it only takes polynomical time to **verify** it
3. **NP-hard** : X is an NP-hard problem if there exists an NP-complete problem Y such that Y is reducible to X in polynomial time
4. **NP-complete**  : X is a problem in NP problem space, for which it is possible to reduce any other NP problem  Y to X in polynomial time

## TODO

- [ ] Add illustrations for clarity
- [ ] Add real problems as examples and algorithms that solve it
